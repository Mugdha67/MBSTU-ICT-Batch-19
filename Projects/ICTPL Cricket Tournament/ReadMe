# 🏏 ICT Premier League Console Game (C++)

Welcome to the **ICT Premier League 2024 Console Game**, a fun and interactive cricket simulation written entirely in **C++**!  
This program lets two teams from different university batches face off in a short 5-over match — with real cricket elements like wickets, wides, no-balls, and even random injuries!
