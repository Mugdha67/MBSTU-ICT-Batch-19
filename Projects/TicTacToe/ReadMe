🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java Console)
📌 Project Overview

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java.
It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with X and O until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
The project demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and input validation in Java.

🧩 Features

✅ Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
✅ Input validation to prevent invalid moves
✅ Detects winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals)
✅ Detects draw condition
✅ Easy-to-read board display in the console

🧠 Concepts Used

2D Arrays for the game board

Loops for repeated turns

Conditional statements for game logic

Scanner class for user input

Functions/Methods for modular code

⚙️ How to Run the Program

Open your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

Create a new Java project and add the code in a file named Main.java

Compile and run the program

Players take turns entering row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2)

Example Input:

Player X, enter your move (row and column 0, 1, or 2):
0 1

🎯 Game Rules

The grid has 3 rows and 3 columns.

Players take turns placing their mark (X or O).

The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
