## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or any Java IDE.  
2. Make sure the JDK (Java Development Kit) is installed and properly configured.  
3. Locate the main class file (for example, `Main.java` or `OScalculator.java`).  
4. Run the program from the IDE or through the terminal using:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
🎯 Learning Outcomes
